Please Please Please,"I know I have good judgment, I know I have good taste"
Please Please Please,It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
Please Please Please,I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
Please Please Please,But just don't
Please Please Please,"I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy"
Please Please Please,"Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight"
Please Please Please,I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
Please Please Please,"Yeah, I know"
Please Please Please,"All I'm asking, baby"
Please Please Please,"Please, please, please"
Please Please Please,Don't prove I'm right
Please Please Please,"And please, pleasе, please"

Please Please Please,"I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh"
Please Please Please,"Please, please, please "
Please Please Please,"Well, I have a fun idea, babe , maybe just stay inside"
Please Please Please,"I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice "
Please Please Please,And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
Please Please Please,"I'm just kidding, but really , really, really"
Please Please Please,"Please, please, please "
Please Please Please,Don't prove I'm right
Please Please Please,"And please, please, please"

Please Please Please,"Please, please, please "
Please Please Please,"Please , please , please"
Bed Chem,I was in a sheer dress the day that we met
Bed Chem,"We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec"
Bed Chem,Your friend hit me up so we could connect

Slim Pickins,Guess I'll end this life alone
Slim Pickins,I am not dramatic
Slim Pickins,These are just the thoughts that pass right through me
Slim Pickins,All the douchebags in my phone
Slim Pickins,Play 'em like a slot machine
Slim Pickins,"If they're winnin', I'm just losin'"
Slim Pickins,A boy who's jacked and kind
Slim Pickins,Can't find his ass to save my life
Slim Pickins,"Oh, it's slim pickings"
Slim Pickins,If I can't have the one I love
Slim Pickins,I guess it's you that I'll be kissin'
Slim Pickins,Just to get my fixings
Slim Pickins,Since the good ones are deceased or taken
Slim Pickins,I'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'
Slim Pickins,Ah-ah-ah-ah
Slim Pickins,Ah-ah-ah-ah
Slim Pickins,"Jesus, what's a girl to do?"
Slim Pickins,This boy doesn't even know
Slim Pickins,"The difference between ""there,"" ""their"" and ""they are"""
Slim Pickins,Yet he's naked in my room
Slim Pickins,Missin' all the things he's missin'
Slim Pickins,God knows that he isn't livin' large
Slim Pickins,A boy who's nice that breathes
Slim Pickins,I swear he's nowhere to be seen
Slim Pickins,It's slim pickings
Slim Pickins,If I can't have the one I love
Slim Pickins,I guess it's you that I'll be kissin'
Slim Pickins,Just to get my fixings
Slim Pickins,Since the good ones are deceased or taken
Slim Pickins,I'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'
Slim Pickins,Moanin' and bitchin'
Slim Pickins,Since the good ones call their exes wasted
Slim Pickins,And since the Lord forgot my gay awakenin'
Slim Pickins,Then I'll just be here in the kitchen
Slim Pickins,Servin' up some moanin' and bitchin'
Sharpest Tool,I know you're not
Sharpest Tool,The sharpest tool in the shed
Sharpest Tool,"We had sex, I met your best friends"
Sharpest Tool,Then a bird flies by and you forget
Sharpest Tool,I don't hear a word
Sharpest Tool,'Til your guilt creeps in
Sharpest Tool,"On a Tuesday, send a soft ""hey"""
Sharpest Tool,As if you really don't recall the time
Sharpest Tool,"We were goin' right, then you took a left"
Sharpest Tool,Left me with a lot of shit to second-guess
Sharpest Tool,Guess I'll waste another year on wonderin' if
Sharpest Tool,"If that was casual, then I'm an idiot"
Sharpest Tool,I'm lookin' for an answer in-between the lines
Sharpest Tool,Lyin' to yourself if you think we'rе fine
Sharpest Tool,"You're confused and I'm upsеt, but"

Dumb And Poetic,You're so dumb and poetic
Dumb And Poetic,"It's just what I fall for, I like the aesthetic"
Dumb And Poetic,"Every self-help book, you've already read it"
Dumb And Poetic,Cherry-pick lines like they're words you invented
Dumb And Poetic,Gold star for highbrow manipulation
Dumb And Poetic,"And ""love everyone"" is your favorite quotation"
Dumb And Poetic,Try to come off like you're soft and well-spoken
Dumb And Poetic,Jack off to lyrics by Leonard Cohen
Dumb And Poetic,Don't think you understand
Dumb And Poetic,Just 'cause you talk like one doesn't make you a man
Dumb And Poetic,You're so sad there's no communication
Dumb And Poetic,"But, baby, you put us in this situation"
Dumb And Poetic,You're running so fast from the hearts that you're breakin'
Dumb And Poetic,Save all your breath for your floor meditation
Dumb And Poetic,"You're so empathetic, you'd make a great wife"
Dumb And Poetic,And I promise the mushrooms aren't changing your life
Dumb And Poetic,"Well, you crashed the car and abandoned the wreckage"
Dumb And Poetic,Fuck with my head like it's some kind of fetish
Dumb And Poetic,Don't think you understand
Dumb And Poetic,Just 'cause you act like one doesn't make you a man
Dumb And Poetic,Don't think you understand
Dumb And Poetic,Just 'cause you leave like one doesn't make you a man

Blueberries,Dandelions are going to seed
Blueberries,It's my soul I need to feed
Blueberries,Trees stand so tall and bare
Blueberries,And here I stand without a care
Blueberries,Pumpkin seeds stuck in my teeth
Blueberries,There's something more I need to be
Blueberries,More than just a silly girl
Blueberries,Waiting for the sun to hurl
Blueberries,Rays of sunlight
Blueberries,"Down the sidewalk, down on me"
Blueberries,Casting light on
Blueberries,The turning leaves and what I'm supposed to see
Blueberries,Winter's here and settled in
Blueberries,But where are you? I can't begin
Blueberries,To imagine where I went wrong
Blueberries,Perhaps it was when I started this song
Blueberries,Rays of sunlight
Blueberries,Reflecting off the snowflakes
Blueberries,There are no more crinkly leaves
Blueberries,I need to rake
Blueberries,There's a chance
Blueberries,A chance I need to take
Blueberries,Birds and bees are here again
Blueberries,We haven't talked since God knows when
Blueberries,I like to dance in the sprouting grass
Blueberries,"If it snows again, then I'll have to ask"
Blueberries,Why the hell are
Blueberries,The seasons fickle just like you?
Blueberries,Rip my heart in half
Blueberries,I'll stitch it up if it's certain we are through
Blueberries,"Junebugs, butterflies, sand in my pants"
Blueberries,Midnight moon and those pesky little ants
Blueberries,You're here once more to try your luck
Blueberries,"Well, I'm done with you, you sneaky little"
Blueberries,Now it's over
Blueberries,There's nothing left for us to do
Blueberries,Besides acknowledging the repelling forces
Blueberries,That are me and you
Right Now,We'll never be as young as we are right now
Right Now,We'll never see the world like we do right now
Right Now,"So take in what's around you, put your camera down"
Right Now,"Take a shot, give it all you got"
Right Now,I have a way of getting stuck on yesterday
Right Now,I tend to miss the little things that come my way
Right Now,"Always looking forward, always looking back"
Right Now,"They seem so near, but they're not here"
Right Now,'Cause time moves on so quickly
Right Now,Without or with me
Right Now,I've got to take a breath
Right Now,"And slow down, slow down, my mind is racing"
Right Now,"Catch up, catch up, I've gotta pace myself"
Right Now,"I'm always wandering, but I don't need to go right now"
Right Now,"Let go, let go , we hold our fears too tight"
Right Now,"Begin, begin  to live your life"
Right Now,The present is our future past
Right Now,We've gotta make this moment last right now
Right Now,Have you ever noticed how your heartbeat feels
Right Now,When you're nervous or excited 'cause it's getting real?
Right Now,Have you stopped to listen to what's in your soul?
Right Now,That's your intuition and it always knows
Right Now,Time moves on so quickly
Right Now,Without or with me
Right Now,I've got to take a breath
Right Now,"And slow down, slow down, my mind is racing"
Right Now,"Catch up, catch up, I've gotta pace myself"
Right Now,"I'm always wandering, but I don't need to go right now"
Right Now,"Let go, let go , we hold our fears too tight"

Right Now,"Oh, right now , right now "
Right Now,"Enjoy the ride, the ride that you're on"
Right Now,"Right now, right now"
Right Now,Yeah
