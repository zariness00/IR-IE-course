I know I have good judgment, I know I have good taste
It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
But just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby
Please, please, please
Don't prove I'm right
And please, pleasе, please
Don't bring me to tеars when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please 
Well, I have a fun idea, babe , maybe just stay inside
I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice 
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really , really, really
Please, please, please 
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing , my ego's another 
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please 
If you wanna go and be stupid
Don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically
Please, please, please 
Please, please, please 
Please , please , please
I was in a sheer dress the day that we met
We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec
Your friend hit me up so we could connect
And what are the odds? You send me a text
And now the next thing I know, I'm like
Manifest that you're oversized
I digress, got me scrollin' like
Out of breath, got me goin' like
Ooh 
Who's the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent? Like
Ooh 
Maybe it's all in my head
But I bеt we'd have really good bеd chem
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round
Oh, it just makes sense
How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things
That's bed  chem 
How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed
Are you free next week?
I bet we'd have really good
Come right on me, I mean camaraderie
Said you're not in my time zone, but you wanna be
Where art thou? Why not uponeth me?
See it in my mind, let's fulfill the prophecy
Ooh 
Who's the cute guy with the wide blue eyes and the big bad mm? Like
Ooh 
I know I sound a bit redundant
But I bet we'd have really good bed chem
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round
Oh, it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things 
That's bed chem 
How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed 
Are you free next week?
I bet we'd have really good 
And I bet we'd both arrive at the same time 
And I bet the thermostat's set at six-nine 
And I bet it's even better than in my head 
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round 
Oh, it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things
That's bed chem 
How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed 
Are you free next week? 
I bet we'd have really good
Ha

No-no-no
Ha

No-no-no, no, oh no, oh
Ha

No-no-no, oh
Ha

Ooh, oh, baby
Don't have to tell your hot ass a thing
Oh yeah, you just get it
Whole package, babe, I like the way you fit
God bless your dad's genetics, mm, uh
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Oh, late at night, I'm thinking 'bout you, ah-ah
Wanna try out my fuzzy pink handcuffs?
Oh, I hear you knockin', baby, come on up
I know you want my touch for life
If you love me right, then who knows?
I might let you make me Juno
You know I just might
Let you lock me down tonight
One of me is cute, but two though?
Give it to me, baby
You make me wanna make you fall in love 
I showed my friends, then we high-fived 
Sorry if you feel objеctified 
Can't help myself, hormonеs are high
Give me more than just some butterflies
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Oh, late at night, I'm thinking 'bout you, ah-ah
Wanna try out some freaky positions?
Have you ever tried this one?
I know you want my touch for life
If you love me right, then who knows?
I might let you make me Juno
You know I just might
Let you lock me down tonight
One of me is cute, but two though?
Give it to me, baby
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Adore me
Hold me and explore me
Mark your territory 
Tell me I'm the only, only, only, only one 
Adore me
Hold me and explore me 
I'm so fuckin' horny
Tell me I'm the only, only, only, only one
Ah
Ooh-ooh
 I know you want my touch for life
If you love me right, then who knows?
I might let you make me Juno
You know I just might 
Let you lock me down tonight
One of me is cute, but two though?
Give it to me, baby
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Oh, I leave quite an impression
Five feet to be exact
You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'
My body's where they're at
Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation
I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do
Just know you'll taste me too
Uh-huh
He pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue
Hе's funny now, all his jokes hit different
Guеss who he learned that from?
Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation
I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do 
Just know you'll taste me too
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Every time you close your eyes
And feel his lips, you're feelin' mine
And every time you breathe his air
Just know I was already there
You can have him if you like
I've been there, done that once or twice
And singin' 'bout it don't mean I care
Yeah, I know I've been known to share
Well, I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do 
Just know you'll taste me too
Taste me too, ow 
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
You, no, yeah, ah-ah 
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
I can't relate to desperation
My give-a-fucks are on vacation
And I got this one boy and he won't stop calling
When they act this way, I know I got 'em
 Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
 Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
 Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
 I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
 That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
 One touch and I brand-newed it for ya 
And now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Holy shit
Is it that sweet? I guess so 
I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer
Oh, he looks so cute wrapped 'round my finger
My twisted humor make him laugh so often
My honeybee, come and get this pollen
 Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
 Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
 Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya 
 I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
 That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
 One touch and I brand-newed it for ya 
Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso 
Thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so 
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso 
Move it up, down, left, right, oh 
Switch it up like Nintendo 
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Mm, that's that me espresso
Maybe we could've been friends
If I met you in another life
Maybe then we could pretend
There's no gravity in the words we write
Maybe you didn't mean it
Maybe "blonde" was the only rhyme
The only rhyme
Want my heart to be breakin', breakin', no
I'm happy and you hate it, hate it, oh
And I'm not asking you to let it go
But you been tellin' your side
So I'll be tellin' mine, oh
You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While hе's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that еven you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in
You're tellin' it how you see it
Like truth is whatever you decide
Some people will believe it
And some will read in between the lines
You're putting me in the spotlight
But I've been under it all my life
Said all my life
Want my heart to be breakin', breakin', no
I'm happy and you hate it, hate it, oh
And I'm not asking you to let it go
But you been tellin' your side
So I'll be tellin' mine 
You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While he's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in, oh
You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While he's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in, oh
I just hope that one day
We both can laugh about it
When it's not in our face
Won't have to dance around it
Don't drive yourself insane
It won't always be this way
You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While he's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in
Oh, mm
Mm
When I love you, I'm sweet like an angel
Drawin' hearts 'round our names
And dreamin' of writing vows, rockin' cradles
Don't mistake my nice for naive
I don't waste a second, I know lots of guys
You do somethin' suspect, this cute ass bye-bye
Like, ooh
Baby, you say you really like it being mine?
So let me give you some advice
Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that so fast
'Cause no one's more amazin'
At turnin' lovin' into hatred
Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that  so fast 
'Cause no one's more amazin'
At turnin' lovin' into hatred
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
That was cool
I won't give a fuck about you 
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
Yeah
I'll tell the world you finish your chores prematurely
Break my heart and I swear I'm movin' on
With your favorite athlete
Shoot his shot every night
Want you every second, don't need other guys
You do somethin' sus, kiss my cute ass bye
Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces 
Or I'll switch it up like that so fast
'Cause no one's more amazin' 
At turnin' lovin' into hatred
Boy, it's not that complicated 
You should stay in my good graces 
Or I'll switch it up like that  so fast 
'Cause no one's more amazin'
At turnin' lovin' into hatred
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
Oh, no
I won't give a fuck about you 
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
Oh
No, I won't
I won't give a fuck about you, no, I won't
No, I won't
I won't give a fuck about you, no, I won't
Guess I'll end this life alone
I am not dramatic
These are just the thoughts that pass right through me
All the douchebags in my phone
Play 'em like a slot machine
If they're winnin', I'm just losin'
A boy who's jacked and kind
Can't find his ass to save my life
Oh, it's slim pickings
If I can't have the one I love
I guess it's you that I'll be kissin'
Just to get my fixings
Since the good ones are deceased or taken
I'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Jesus, what's a girl to do?
This boy doesn't even know
The difference between "there," "their" and "they are"
Yet he's naked in my room
Missin' all the things he's missin'
God knows that he isn't livin' large
A boy who's nice that breathes
I swear he's nowhere to be seen
It's slim pickings
If I can't have the one I love
I guess it's you that I'll be kissin'
Just to get my fixings
Since the good ones are deceased or taken
I'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'
Moanin' and bitchin'
Since the good ones call their exes wasted
And since the Lord forgot my gay awakenin'
Then I'll just be here in the kitchen
Servin' up some moanin' and bitchin'
I know you're not
The sharpest tool in the shed
We had sex, I met your best friends
Then a bird flies by and you forget
I don't hear a word
'Til your guilt creeps in
On a Tuesday, send a soft "hey"
As if you really don't recall the time
We were goin' right, then you took a left
Left me with a lot of shit to second-guess
Guess I'll waste another year on wonderin' if
If that was casual, then I'm an idiot
I'm lookin' for an answer in-between the lines
Lyin' to yourself if you think we'rе fine
You're confused and I'm upsеt, but
We never talk about it
We never talk about it
We never talk about it
All the silence just makes it worse, really
'Cause it leaves you so top-of-mind for me
All the silence is just your strategy
'Cause it leaves you so top-of-mind for me
We never talk about how you
Found God at your ex's house, always
Made sure that the phone was face-down
Seems like overnight, I'm just the bitch you hate now
We never talk it through
How you guilt-tripped me to open up to you
Then you logged out
, leavin' me dumbfounded, oh-oh
We were goin' right, then you took a left
Left me with a lot of shit to second-guess
Guess I'll waste another year on wonderin' if
If that was casual, then I'm an idiot
I'm lookin' for an answer in-between the lines
Lyin' to yourself if you think we're fine
You're confused and I'm upset, but
We never talk about it 
We never talk about it 
We never talk about it 
We never talk about how you
Found God at your ex's house, always
Made sure that the phone was face-down
Seems like overnight, 
I'm just the bitch you hate now
We never talk it through
How you guilt-tripped me to open up to you
Then you logged out, leavin' me dumbfounded, oh-oh
We don't talk about it
, we don't talk about it 
We don't talk about it, talk, talk, talk about it 
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it 
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it
You're so dumb and poetic
It's just what I fall for, I like the aesthetic
Every self-help book, you've already read it
Cherry-pick lines like they're words you invented
Gold star for highbrow manipulation
And "love everyone" is your favorite quotation
Try to come off like you're soft and well-spoken
Jack off to lyrics by Leonard Cohen
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you talk like one doesn't make you a man
You're so sad there's no communication
But, baby, you put us in this situation
You're running so fast from the hearts that you're breakin'
Save all your breath for your floor meditation
You're so empathetic, you'd make a great wife
And I promise the mushrooms aren't changing your life
Well, you crashed the car and abandoned the wreckage
Fuck with my head like it's some kind of fetish
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you act like one doesn't make you a man
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you leave like one doesn't make you a man
(
One, two, a-one, two, three, woo
)
The second I put my head on your chest
She knew, she's got a real sixth sense
Now her name comes up once, then it comes up twice
And without her even bein' here, she's back in your life
Now she's in the same damn city on the same damn night
And you've lost all your common sense
What a coincidence
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na
Last week, you didn't have any doubts
This week, you're holdin' space for her tongue in your mouth
Now shе's sendin' you some pictures wеarin' less and less
Tryna turn the past into the present tense, huh
Suckin' up to all of your mutual friends
And you've lost all your common sense 
The way you told me the truth, minus seven percent 
What a coincidence, uh
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
What a surprise, your phone just died
Your car drove itself from L.A. to her thighs
Palm Springs looks nice, but who's by your side?
Damn it, she looks kinda like the girl you outgrew
Least that's what you said 
What a coincidence
Oh  wow, you just broke up again
What a coincidence
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na 
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na 
Don't smile because it happened, baby
Cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her
My heart is heavy now, it's like a hundred pounds
It's fallin' faster than the way you love to shut me down
I think I need a shower, my friends are takin' shots
You think it's happy hour, for me, it's not
Don't smile because it happened, baby
Cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her
Don't smile becausе it happened, baby
Cry becausе it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her
Pour my feelings in the microphone
I stay in, and when the girls come home
I want one of them to take my phone
Take my phone and lose your
Number, I don't wanna be tempted
Pick up when you wanna fall back in
You can fake it, but you know I know
Know I know
Don't smile because it happened, baby 
Cry because it's over 
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her 
Don't smile because it happened, baby
Cry because it's over 
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her
Don't swear on your mom
That it's the first drink that you've had in like a month
No, don't say it was just
An isolated incident that happened once
There's no need to pretend
I've never seen an ugly truth that I can't bend
To something that looks better
I'm stupid, but I'm clever
Yeah, I can make a shitshow look a whole lot like forever and ever
You don't have to lie to girls
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Like you, they'll just lie to themselves
You don't have to lie to girls
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Don't I know it better than anyone else?
All of your best excuses
No, they don't stand a chance
Against all the chances I give you
Isn't ideal, but damn
You don't even have to try
Turn you into a good guy
You don't have to lift a finger
It's lucky for you I'm just like
My mother 
All my 
The girl outside the strip club getting her tarot cards read
We love to read the cold, hard facts and swear they're incorrect
We love to mistake butterflies for cardiac arrest
You don't have to lie to girls
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Like you, they'll just lie to themselves
You don't have  to lie to girls 
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Don't I know it better than anyone else?
Girls will cry and girls will lie and
Girls will do it 'til they die for you
They'll cry and girls will lie and
Do it 'til the day they die for you 
Girls will cry and girls will lie and 
Girls will lose their goddamn minds for you 
They'll cry and girls will lie and
Do it 'til the day they die for you
Oh
I'm so mature, collected and sensible
Except when I get hit with rejection
To turn me down, well, that's just unethical
I'll turn into someone you're scared to know
But if you need my love
My clothes are off, I'm comin' over to your place
And if you don't need  my love
Well, I didn't want your little bitch-ass anyway
Yeah, I'm a busy woman
I wouldn't let you come into my calendar any night
But if you want my kisses
I'll be your perfect Mrs. 'til the day that one of us dies 
Busy woman, all the time
Busy woman
So much to shave and lipstick to reapply
Maybe for you, though, I could accommodate
I'm flexible, so just tell me what you like
Tantric yoga, baby, namaste
If you don't want me, I'll just deem you gay
But if you need my love
My clothes are off, I'm comin' over to your place 
And if you don't need  my love
Well, I didn't want your little bitch-ass anyway
Yeah, I'm a busy woman
I wouldn't let you come into my calendar any night
But if you want my kisses
I'll be your perfect Mrs. 'til the day that one of us dies
Busy woman, all the time
Busy woman for the rest of my life
My openings are super tight
Busy woman, unless you call tonight
Night 
Ooh
But if you need my love
My clothes are off, I'm comin' over to your place 
And if you don't need  my love 
Well, I didn't want your little bitch-ass anyway
'Cause I'm a busy woman 
I wouldn't let you come into my calendar any night
But if you want my kisses
I'll be your perfect Mrs. 'til the day that one of us dies
Somewhere in the world, there is a father and a mother
And the father is a son who has a mother
The mother has a daughter who gets married to the brother of a mother
And they all just tryna multiply with one another
'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends 'til the end, then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
Somewhere in the world, they think they're working for themselves
They get up every day to go to work for someone else
And somebody works for them, and so they think they got it made
But they're all just working to get paid the very same
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum 
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum 
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum 
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum 
Somewhere in the world, you got a robber and a bank
And the bank robbed the people, so the people rob the bank
And the police came to get him, but they let him get away
'Cause they're all just working to get paid the very same
'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends 'til the end, then you start again 
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum 
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum 
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum 
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum 
Don't believe everything that you hear
Let it go through your left and right ear
Don't just march to the beat of that drum
Don't be one of them people just twiddlin' them thumbs
'Cause that's just the way of the world 
It never ends 'til the end, and then you start again 
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs 
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum 
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum 
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum 
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs 
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs 
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum 
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum 
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh 
Da-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to "Don't Leave Me Alone"
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh
But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-blee"
I don't want no one else , baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote , it's about you and me 
I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' 
I'm talkin' all around the clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
I'm talkin' opposite of soft
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?
But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-bleh-blee"
And I don't want no one else , baby, I'm in too deep 
Here's a lil' song I wrote , it's about you and me
I'll be honest 
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense 
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in 
When you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense 
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' , I'm talkin'
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah 
I don't even know anymore
This song catchier than chickenpox is
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a pop hit, ha-ha
How quickly can you take your clothes off? Pop quiz
That one's not gonna make it
Most of these aren't gonna make—
I said I wanted Thin Mints and you said you knew a guy
You showed up with a boombox and stars in your eyes
Who knew cuddling on trampolines could be so reckless?
We bonded over Black Eyed Peas and complicated exes
Fell so deeply into it
It was all so innocent
Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked
I'm the hot topic on your tongue
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy
Ah, mmm
I'm not catastrophizing, everything's derailing
Was only tryna hold you close while your heart was failing
It's not internet illusion, just two kids going through it
You said I'm too late to be your first love, but I'll always be your favorite
Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked
I'm the hot topic on your tongue
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy
Ah
Ah
Ah
All because I liked a boy
Fell so deeply into it
It was all so innocent
Dating boys with exes
No, I wouldn't recommend it
I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy
And all of this for what?
When everything went down, we'd already broken up
Please tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy
Ah 
Ah 
Ah
All because I liked a boy
Oh, not another take
Oh, it's like that, I'm your dream come true
When it's on a platter for you
Then you pull back when I try to make plans
More than two hours in advance, mm
I slam the door, I hit ignore
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked, after this, an afterthought
I finally cut you off
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind 
Floatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time 
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic"
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life
With you out my life
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah
It feels so good
Not carin' where you are tonight
And it feels so good
Not pretendin' to like the wine you like
I slam the door , I hit ignore 
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked, excited to never talk, I
I'm so sorry for your loss
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind 
Floatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time 
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch 
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic"
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life
With you out my life
Ah, mm
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather
You want me? I'm done
You miss me? No duh
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at
You want me? I'm done 
You miss me? No duh 
Where I'm at, I'm up  where I'm at
You want me? I'm done
You miss me? No duh
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at
You want me? I'm done
You miss me? No duh
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at
It's times like these, wish I had a time machine
So I could see what you did October 13th
At 10:15, were you really asleep?
Were you lyin' to me and the family?
There's no "us" in us when I'm lackin' trust
You wanna discuss, ugh, you disgust me
Don't make me cuss you out, why'd you let me down?
Don't say sorry now
And thanks to you, I, I can't love right
I get nice guys and villainize them
Read their texts like they're havin' sex right now
Scared I'll find out that it's true
And if I do, then I blame you
For every worst that I assume
When I'm forty-five, someone calls me their wife
And he fucks our lives in one selfish night
Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did
And God, I love you, but you're such a dipshit
Please fuckin' fix this
'Cause you were all I looked up to
Now I can't even look at you
I mean, as they say in Chicago
"He had it comin'"
The clock is tickin' lately
Guess that means I'm doin' somethin' right
Been here a long time, baby
But gosh, I hope I make it through the night
It's fleetin' like my battery life
Hard to hold on to like every guy
When you're hot, it's just a matter of time
But I can do a lot with fifteen minutes
Lot of pretty boys, lot of funny business
Take a couple bucks, turn 'em into millions
You, you, you know I
I can do a lot with fifteen minutes
Only gonna take two to make you finish
Piss some people off, show 'em what they're missin'
You, you, you know I can
Where did all these parties come from?
Whеn did all you bitches get so nice?
Runnin' out of thе woodwork
And hopin' there's no brain between my eyes 
Well, it's fleetin' like we're all gonna die 
Hard to hold like conversations when high 
When you're hot, they're gonna eat you alive 
Oh
But I can do a lot with fifteen minutes 
Lot of pretty boys, lot of funny business 
Take a couple bucks, turn 'em into millions
You, you, you know I
I can do a lot with fifteen minutes 
Only gonna take two to make you finish 
Piss some people off, show 'em what they're missin' 
You, you, you know I can
 Ooh
You know I 
You know I 
When my time's up, baby 
I'll leak some pictures maybe
Say somethin' batshit crazy
I'll do it, don't you make me
When my time's up, baby 
I'll leak some pictures maybe 
Say somethin' batshit crazy 
I'll do it, don't you make me, yeah, oh 
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh 
Uh, I'll do it 
Oh, I'll do it
Oh, I'll do it, babe
You like New York City in the daytime
I like New York City in the nighttime
You say you like sleeping with the air off
I don't, I need it on
You like the light coming through the windows
I sleep late, so I just keep 'em all closed
You ignore the music on the radio
I don't, I sing along
I don't ask for you to change, baby, no, no, no
And you don't ask for me to change
Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well and we don't even know why
You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well and we don't even know why
We don't even know why, no, no
We don't even know why, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
We like it in the end of time
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
We like it in the end of time
Cold outside and you're just in a T-shirt
I have cold blood even in a sweater
You start your night sippin' by the Kilo
I don't, I know you know
I don't ask for you to change, baby, no, no, no
And you don't ask for me to change
Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well and we don't even know why
You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well and we don't even know why
We don't even know why, no, no 
We don't even know why, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime 
We like it in the end of time 
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
We like it in the end of time
Somehow, we end up on the same side
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
Even our eyes are different colors, but we see fine
Somehow, we end up on the same side 
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
Even our eyes are different colors, but we see fine
 Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well and we don't even know why
You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well and we don't even know why
We don't even know why, no, no
We don't even know why, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime 
We like it in the end of time 
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
We like it in the nighttime
Oh, what I'd give to be
Meeting you as the glass-half-full version of me
I was easier than I am now
Would've folded, but I can't now
Heard they say this emotion should be kind
But I couldn't make it
Any harder to love me
Your arms are reachin'
And your eager heart is throbbing
I know you're frustrated
'Cause I will not let you touch me
You say you can take it
But you don't know how hard I can make it
Fuckboys you'll never meet
Well, you can thank them for why I'm so goddamn reactionary
And for the graveyard in my stomach
Filled with pivotal formative comments
Meanwhile, you're just tryna tell me I look nice 
But I couldn't make it
Any harder to love me
Your arms are reachin'
And your eager heart is throbbing
I know you're frustrated
'Cause I will not let you touch me
You say you can take it
But you don't know how hard I can make it
Oh no
Oh
I couldn't make it
Any harder to love me
Oh, one day, believe me
You'll want someone that makes it easy
I've heard all the bad news and the bad reviews
Couple bad gut feelings, well, I've had them too
But still I choose to be in love with you
Been alone for so long, I've got somethin' to prove
If I close an eye, it's almost like your red flags are blue
So still I choose to be in love with you
Short fuse and long baths like you're fresh out of rehab
And I'm fresh out of any good judgment
I'm intentionally careless, least I got self-awareness
Just want someone to love me who doesn't
I've heard all the bad news and the bad reviews
All the friends tryna save me, well, I, I cut them loose
'Cause I refuse to be wrong again
And I can't lose another boy that's not even my boyfriend
Still I choose to be in love with you
Ooh, still I choose to be in love with you
It'll be a Wednesday
And I'll be goin' to this coffee shop
Hear the barista call an oat milk latte and your name
And I look up from my phone
And think there's no chance it's you, but it is
You'll say, "Hi," I'll say, "Hi, how are you?"
You'll say, "How's your family? How's your sister?"
I'll say, "Shannon's bein' Shannon"
After a minute of nonsensical chatter, you'll say
"Well, this was really nice, maybe we should do this on purpose sometime"
And it'll have been long enough that we won't harp on 
Arguments in your garage
All the ways we sabotaged it 
What it was and what it wasn't
We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff
I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship
It'd bе so nice, right? Right?
If we could take it all off and just еxist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge
You'll suggest a restaurant we used to go to
And I'll say, "Won't that be too nostalgic?"
And you'll say, "Maybe, but let's do it anyway
We won't sit at our same old table, I promise
And we won't bring up the past, we'll keep it bureaucratic"
And we won't say it, but both of us, we'll be thinkin' about
How different we are from those scared little kids that had those 
Arguments in your garage
All the ways we sabotaged it 
What it was and what it wasn't
We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff
I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship
It'd be so nice, right? Right?
If we could take it all off and just exist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha
We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff
I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship
It'd be so nice, right? Right
If we could take it all off and just exist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge
One year, ten thousand bad moments
But it was dressed up in heated emotion
And I tried to look for the best in the worst
But like, fuck me, that caused a commotion
You're lucky I'm a private person
I've quietly carried your burden
And everyone thinks you're an angel
But shit, I would probably use different wordin'
Oh, you're so vicious
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Crush my heart and wreck my image
Why you gotta be so vicious?
You like a certain type of woman
Who's smart, but neglects intuition
When you're insecure, could be me, could be her
You just run to whoever is winnin' 
Said that it was me and you for life
Now you're kinda acting like I died
Oh, you're so vicious
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Crush my heart and wreck my image
Why you gotta be so, so, so
Oh, you're so vicious 
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Half of me just can't resist it
Why you gotta be so vicious?
Oh, no
Why you gotta be so
Oh, oh
Why you gotta be so vicious?
You don't feel remorse, you don't feel the effects
'Cause you don't think you hurt me if you wish me the best
I shoulda known all along, I was only the next one
To take your love songs as a promise
Oh, you're so vicious
I loved you, but I wish I didn't
If you're out there somewhere listenin'
Why you gotta be so vicious?
Your eyes crashin' into my eyes
Was I accidentally falling in love?
Your words didn't mean to heal the hurt
We're coincidentally more than enough
All these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much, who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
 Hey, huh, hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
 Hey, huh, hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
My dreams runnin' into your dreams
It's as if we wished on the same star
And my time changin' all of your time
It's a butterfly effect on my heart
And all these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much, who knew?
Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you
Oh, woah
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
 Hey, huh , hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
 Hey, huh, hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness, you're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness, you're my focus
Love me hopeless
Oh, you're scared
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Lost in darkness, you're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness, you're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Remember when you said it, there's no second chance?
Oh, baby, I heard you been hoping you could change the past
You miss the long goodnights, you miss the long goodbyes
You miss the long goodnights 
Well, did you ever think that it was hard for me
To walk it off like nothing happened, nonchalantly?
I got you feeling like, I got you feeling right
I got you feeling like 
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself can't be illegal, illegal
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me for being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me
(
Go
)
It's hard to see me on when you been off as hell
But I'm not gonna dull myself because you dull yourself
I know it's hard to see what you don't want to see
I know it's hard to see 
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself can't be illegal, illegal
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me for being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me
I, I, I
I guess I'm hard to ignore
Pick up that jaw off the floor
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me for being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me
Sue me, baby
No, no
It's the holiday remix
Ah-ah
Think I only want you under my mistletoe
I might change your contact to "Has a Huge North Pole"
You said you like my stockings better on the floor
Boy, I've been a bad girl, I guess I'm gettin' coal, no
Let me come warm you up, you been out in the snow
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like, 
"Ho, ho, ho"
I don't want Santa's elves underneath this ol' tree
Here's a lil' carol I wrote, it's about you and me 
You're my wish list
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' Christmas
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin'
And when you're comin' down the chimney
Oh, it feels so good
I need that Charles Dickens
You'll be Santa Claus and I'll be Mrs. 
I'll take you for a ride, I'll be your Vixen
I don't even know, I'm talkin' Christmas
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' 
I'm talkin' deckin' all the halls
I'm talkin' spikin' eggnog
I'm talkin' opposite of small
I'm talkin' big snowballs
You got a new toy for me
I'm out here trimmin' the tree
I caught that holiday glee
My true love gave it to me
Let me come warm you up, you been out in the snow
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like, "Ho, ho, ho, ho"
And I don't want Santa's elves  underneath this ol' tree 
Here's a lil' carol I wrote , it's about you and me
You're my wish list 
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' Christmas 
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin' 
And when you're comin' down the chimney
Oh, it feels so good
I need that Charles Dickens 
You'll be Santa Claus and I'll be Mrs. 
I'll take you for a ride, I'll be your Vixen
I don't even know, I'm talkin' Christmas 
I'm talkin' , I'm talkin', I'm talkin' 
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' , I'm talkin'
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah 
I'm talkin' chestnuts 
I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
Look at all those presents, that's a big sack
Boy, that package is too big to gift wrap
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a Christ-smash
How quickly can you build a snowman? Think fast
Oh
You're good at the fallin', not the stayin' there
You're good at the givin' too much, then gettin' scared
You're good at impersonating someone who cares
And you had me for a minute there
But now I wonder why
I let your confusion keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Reread every single undertone and I
Overanalyzed it
Front, back, and beside it
Where else can we go?
There's nothin' left hеre to decode
Donе lookin' for signs in
The gaps and the silence
It's just gettin' old
There's nothin' left here to decode
Mm, mm-mm
There's a weight off my shoulders now that I don't chase you
Bein' myself, did that emasculate you?
Learnin' from you that I can walk away too
And you had me for a minute too
But now I wonder why
I let your indecision keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Unpacked every single word you wrote and I
Overanalyzed it
Front, back, and beside it
Where else can we go?
There's nothin' left here to decode
Done lookin' for signs in
The gaps and the silence
It's just gettin' old
There's nothin' left here to decode
Mm, mm-mm
There's nothin' left here to decode
Mm, mm-mm
Now I wonder why
I let your confusion keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Reread every single undertone and I
Overanalyzed it
Front, back, and beside it
Where else can we go?
There's nothin' left here to decode
Done lookin' for signs in
The gaps and the silence
It's just gettin' old
There's nothin' left here to decode
There's nothin', there's nothin', there's nothin' 
There's nothin' left here to decode
There's nothin', there's nothin', there's nothin' 
There's nothin' left here to decode
I wanna make a video to our future selves
We were never in the park
Talkin' on a seesaw teetering with our feelings in the dark
Ignoring tornado warnings
He didn't hold me in his arms
We didn't stumble over the pages of our relationship arc
Ignoring tornado warnings
Don't understand how quickly we get
Right back in our rhythm without missing a step
And logically the last thing I should have on my mind
But I want you there sometimes
I guess maybe that's why I'm lying to my therapist
I keep saying things like, "I never saw him and we never kissed"
Now I think somehow in my mind
If I could convince him, if he doesn't see it, then maybe it doesn't exist
I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch
I'm lying to my therapist
I deserve an hour in a week to focus on my thoughts
Not so obsessed with yours, I can't hear myself speak
I deserve my own consideration, but sometimes, 
I wish I kept
Some of my feelings in the basement so I'd still have some left
Don't understand how quickly we get
Right back in our rhythm without missing a step
And logically the last thing I should have on my mind
But I want you there sometimes
I guess maybe that's why I'm lying to my therapist
I keep saying things like, "I never saw him and we never kissed"
Now I think somehow in my mind
If I could convince him, if he doesn't see it, then maybe it doesn't exist
I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch
I'm lying to my therapist
I'll drive you home, you drive me crazy
But that's not gonna stop me
I'll call you out, you call me "baby"
But that's not gonna stop me
From lying to my therapist
I keep saying things like, "I never saw him and we never kissed"
Now I think somehow in my mind
If I could convince him, if he doesn't see it, then maybe it doesn't exist
I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch
I'm lying to my therapist
Ah
Made it clear when you told me 
Don't know why, but you gotta be lonely 
Say it's hard, but you make it look easy 
So I'm tryin' to live in reality 
Decompressin', tryna ease the tension, but you
Got me stressin', feelin' like I need to call when
You sneak up on me, tell me that you miss me in your life
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line
Wastin' all our time
To think that we could be casual
You're not my friend and, baby, you never were
Why the fuss if you say you just wanna be mine?
I can't read your mind
Tell me, what's gonna happen
When it's you and me in a room, but you know you can't have it?
Oh, I'll be laughin'
When you say that you really have changed
Finally found your way
'Cause I'm close to your face 
Double-checkin', did I get the message in the way
You intended? Got me second-guessin' when you
Sneak up on me, tell me that you need me in your life
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call
You say  you know  that you might be crossin' a line
Wastin' all our time
To think that we could be casual
You're not my friend and, baby, you never were
Why the fuss if you say you just wanna be mine?
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call 
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line
Wastin' all our time 
To think  that we could be casual
You're not  my friend  and, baby, you never were
Why  the fuss  if you say you just wanna be mine?
I can't read your mind
Ha-ah-ah-ah, la, mm-mm
Sun's up too soon like daylight savings
Mixed emotions are congregating
Picturin' us in all these places
Ahead of myself's an understatement
Sky looks so purple, I can taste it
Couple days in, I call you "baby"
Three stories up here contemplatin'
But what the fuck is patience?
These are fast times and fast nights, yeah
No time for rewrites, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I evеr really meant it
Fast times and fast nights, yеah
Closed eyes and closed blinds, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
My feelings used to be serrated
But you speak in such a perfect cadence
Tiptoeing past so many stages
But what the fuck is patience?
These are fast times and fast nights, yeah
No time for rewrites, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
Fast times and fast nights, yeah
Closed eyes and closed blinds, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
These, these are
These are the fast times
These, these are
These are the—
Fast times and fast nights, yeah 
No time for rewrites, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah 
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
Fast times and fast nights, yeah
Closed eyes and closed blinds, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
Mmm, no, hmm
This feeling's so alien
Need to know if you're just a friend
Are you a secret I'm holdin' in?
So leave it on my brain if you feel the same
Lie but I notice it
Don't know the rules but I got to win
The paranoia is sinkin' in
So leave it on my brain if you feel the same
Ooh, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know
No, no, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know
Don't let me leave when I'm standing at your door
Don't make me stop when you're really wanting more
When you're really wanting more
If you show me what you were thinking of
Let me get inside your mind
If you show me love it'll be enough
It'll be a better night
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night
Alienated them
Right about when our love began
Emotions are moving in
Getting in my space, livin' in my place
When did these games begin?
I'm overthinking my thoughts again
No, we don't break, but we're bound to bend
Getting in my space, livin' in my place
Ooh, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know
No, no, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know
Don't let me leave when I'm standing at your door
Baby no, don't let me
Don't make me stop when you're really wanting more
'Cause I know you're wanting more
If you show me what you were thinking of
Let me get inside your mind
If you show me love it'll be enough
It'll be a better night
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night 
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night 
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night
A better night, yeah
Who put the baby in charge?
It's already hard to buy all the parts and learn to use them
Who put the world on my back and not in my hands?
Just give me a chance
Listen to my mama, listen to my dad
Listen to my sisters, everyone relax
Everybody answers shit I didn't ask
Think I'm reaching my limit
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can I get this out in the open?
Can I sit down for a second?
Can I breathe?
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can we talk it out? I don't get it
Can I calm down for a moment?
Can I breathe for just one second?
I put too much weight on words and glances
I, I put too much weight on situations
I, I put too much on myself
Thinking I don't deserve what I've earned, but yeah
I listen to the labels, listen to the man
Try to keep a sense of knowing who I am
I try to be an angel, but I don't think I can
Think I'm reaching my limits, yeah
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can I get this out in the open?
Can I sit down for a second?
Can I breathe?
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can we talk it out? I don't get it
Can I calm down for a moment?
Can I breathe for just one second, baby?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Na-na-na, na-na-na, nay
Na-na-na, na-na-na, nay
Na-na-na, na-na-na, nay
Na-na-na, na-na-na, nay
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
You used a fork once
It turns out forks are fuckin' everywhere
There’s no hiding from the thought of us
I got ways to find you anywhere
We sat on the roof once
Conversation took us everywhere
And we talked until the sun came up
I wish we stayed just like we were up there
I consider you, I'm not trying to
It doesn't matter whether not I want to
I can’t help it, it's a habit
Your corner in my mind is well-established
I
I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I'm in-between
I feel myself fallin' further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about
Before, before you get to me
Remember when you left once?
That never made too much sense to me
Well, it hurt you so bad hurting me
You really came to me for sympathy
Oh, I consider you and I'm not trying to
It doesn't matter whether not I want to
I can't help it, it's a habit
Your corner in my mind is well-established
I
I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I’m in-between
And I feel myself falling further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about
Before, before you get to me
Am I not even a second thought?
I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I’m in-between
I feel myself fallin' further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about
Before, before you get to me
Wonder how many things
Guess you think it's kinda funny
All the boys who love-and-left me
In New York now, getting laid
Guess you think it's entertaining
Early-twenties judgment
Oh, it gets you off, how much you love it
You need
Need less to say about everything
Need more to do than just focus on me
Try working on you
I promise you'll be much happier if you do
A pretty dress, an awkward angle
I bet you zoomed in close and held it up to show all of your friends
So much spite, I bet it's painful
One-way conversations
How's the weather in your mother's basement?
You need
Need less to say about еverything
Need more to do than just focus on me
Try working on you
I promisе you'll be much happier if you do
You need
Need lessons on immaturity
Need more to do than just comment at me
Try working on you
I promise you'll be much happier if you do 
You do
Needless to say
Needless to say
Needless to say
Oh, so you do have a type and it's not me
Oh, so you can reply, just to not me
If you wanted brown eyes
I coulda got contacts
So y'all are in Paris now, guess it's public
Face like that other girl you're in love with
You knew I would see that
You knew I would notice
She looks nothing like me
Can't really tell, should I be
Tryna take it as a compliment?
It's kinda feelin' like the opposite
She looks nothing like me
So why do you look so happy?
Now I think I get the cause of it
You were holdin' out to find the opposite
And I know now
Even if I tried to change
That somehow
You'd end up with her anyway
Oh, I know now
Even if I tried to change
That somehow
You'd end up with her anyway
Does she say nothin' so you feel good?
Does she step out the spotlight so you bathe in it?
Does she get up on top of you more than I would?
Does she just love the picture 'cause you're paintin' it? 
I care, but I don't
Just wonderin', when you 
Said I'm beautiful
Was I bein' lied to?
She looks nothing like me
Can't really tell, should I be
Tryna take it as a compliment?
It's kinda feelin' like the opposite
She looks nothing like me
So why do you look so happy?
Now I think I get the cause of it
You were holdin' out to find the opposite
And I know now
Even if I tried to change 
That somehow
You'd end up with her anyway
Oh, I know now
Even if I tried to change
That somehow 
You'd end up with her anyway 
End up with her anyway
Oh
Oh, yeah
Did I catch your attention?
You look like you lost your breath, huh
When I circle the room, you an owl, you gon' twist your head
Don't you come at me green with an attitude
When my lips and my soles are red
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks
No, no
'Cause I've been here once or twice
Never worry 'bout the eyes 
Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet
If you think they looking at you
They looking at me
I could make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me
They looking at me
Yeah, yeah, they looking at me
Yes, I'm young for a teacher, I'll teach you what you don't know
But I can't give it up all at once, you would overdose
Don't you bring any bull in the room tonight
It's a whole new rodeo
It could be you and me, but you know that I'll steal the show
Oh 
'Cause I've been here once or twice
Never worry 'bout the eyes
Never worry 'bout the eyes 
Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet
If you think they looking at you
They looking at me
I could make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead 
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me
They looking at me
Yeah, yeah, they looking at me (
They're looking at me
)
But they looking at me, babe (
They're looking at me
)
'Cause they looking at me, baby
They're looking at me
They're looking at me
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks
Don't just stand there staring, honey 
Try to move your feet 
If you think they looking at you
They looking at me

Yeah, yeah, they looking at me
(
They're looking at me
)
Don't you know that they looking at me?
(
They're looking at me
)
They looking at me
We been talkin' for hours
'Bout how we shouldn't talk for hours on end
Kissin' after a conversation
'Bout how we'd probably be better off as friends
Same time here next weekend
Say we won't do this again
Make me fall where I stand
Only like you can
Yeah, I say I'm done, but I'm still confused
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure?
And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
Selfishly don't wanna give you
Time to be on someone else's lips 
But I'll take three short hours over
Three long weeks pretendin' like we don't exist, hmm 
Same time here next weekend
Say we won't do this again
Make me fall where I stand
Only like you can
Yeah, I say I'm done, but I'm still confused
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure?
And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
After the aftermath, I know you'll be comin' back
To the back bedroom and it won't be the last
Of the aftermath, I know you'll be comin' back
To the back bedroom and it won't be the last time
I say I'm done, but I'm still confused
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure? 
And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
Yeah, I like my bed, but it likes you too
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
The moment when the light is red before the go
The moment when the curtain's down before the show
The moment when you're done, but maybe just one more
That's how I feel before I get you all alone
We could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
When we could push all the limits
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shirt hanging off my shoulders
Both hands wanna hold ya
So baby, what's the hold up?
Yeah, yeah
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Almost love, it's almost love
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Almost love, it's almost love
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost lo-lo-love
Almost love, but it could be love
It could be love
It could be, yeah
I want you like a midnight hour wants a view
I want you like a loner wants an empty room
I want you like a kiss that's long and overdue
I need you more than I have ever needed you
And we could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
When we could push all the limits
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shirt hanging off my shoulders
Both hands wanna hold ya
So baby, what's the hold up?
Yeah
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Almost love, it's almost love
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Almost love, it's almost love
Almost love
It's almost love, but it could be love
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Almost love, but it could be love
It could be love
It could be, yeah, oh no
We could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're getting it so close
Now you're getting this so close
Almost love, almost love
Oh, 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
It's almost love
Almost love, oh baby, oh
It's almost love, but it could be love
'Cause it's almost love, but it could be love
Almost love and you know
Almost love
But it could be love
'Cause it's almost love, but it could be love
Yeah, it could be love, eh
If I asked that boy to jump, I know he would
He don't even have to say, it's understood
He treat me nice, he treat me right, he treat me good
Still I get so hesitant, still I get so hesitant
So I took myself where I think I should be
Something told me that it's waiting here for me
Parisian nights, Parisian high, Parisian breeze
Feeding me like medicine, feeding me like medicine, yeah
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
Yeah, I already have love in L.A. 
If you show me too much love, it makes me leave 
Guess that's one of many things that's wrong with me 
Looking past you when you're right in front of me
I won't do that anymore, I won't do that anymore 
Why'd it take so long for me to know this? 
Scared to put the water with the roses 
Halfway 'cross the world for me to notice
But I notice, yeah, I notice, yeah
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
Je ne voulais pas trouver l'amour
Mais Paris a quelque chose
Qui donne envie d'aimer, d'aimer passionnément
Mon cœur est à toi pour toujours
You will always have my heart
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. (
Already have love
)
It's so romantic in Paris (
So romantic in Paris
)
Won't even try to compare it (
I know that I try
)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
It's so romantic in Paris, babe
Won't even try to compare it (
Won't even try, won't even try
)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it (
Thought I was sure, I was sure
)
But I already have love in L.A. 
But I already have love in L.A. 
"Baby, sorry I left you in the dark"
"I always reach for your leg over there on your side of the car"
"Baby, everything reminds me of you"
"Nobody gets my jokes, everyone here thinks I'm fuckin' rude"
"When I saw you cry, I didn't handle it well"
"Without you here, I don't know what to do with myself"
I think about these things at night before I fall asleep
Things I wish you said to me
Things like, "Darlin', I hope you know it scared me to death
The night that your sister said that you got in an accident"
"And God, I, I'm watchin' everything that you do"
"I can't get your songs out of my head or your hair out of my room"
"I saw you met somebody and I'm jealous as hell
That I can't even stomach lovin' somebody else"
I think about these things at night before I fall asleep
Things I wish you said to me
Ooh
Ooh, ah
"Sorry that I pulled the 'it's not you, it's me'"
"One day, I'll make sure you get a real apology"
I waste my time, I waste my life on idiotic things
Like things you never said
Things you'll never say to me
I saw you laughin' in one of his pictures
Bet you'll be the one with his ring on your finger
There's red and green everywhere, but I'm so blue
Cindy Lou Who
Maybe he met you somewhere in the desert
While he was soul-searchin', he found someone better
Guess you make him happy like I couldn't do
Cindy Lou Who
 With your hair so long, lips so red
 Maybe we met once, I forget
 Scrollin' five yеars back, I'm obsessed
Breakin' my hеart, 'tis the season, I guess
 With your hair so long, lips so red
 If you're wakin' up now in his old bed
 At his family's house, know that you're just
Breakin' my heart, 'tis the season, I guess
The snow's gonna fall and the tree's gonna glisten
And I'm gonna puke at the thought of you kissin'
The boy who I love is now in love with you
Cindy Lou Who
I told all my friends, they said it can't be true
Cindy Lou Who
Here I am again, the same old situation
Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated?
I should've played it cool, instead, I made a fool
Oh, the things I do
'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh, oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Ooh, ooh
I should've shut my mouth, I could've kept it quiet
I might have freaked him out 'cause I was so excited
But I just couldn't wait, I took a leap of faith
Oh, the things I say
'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh, oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh, no, no
And I think sometimes
I tend to be my own worst enemy
And maybe someday
I'm gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue
Doing what I do
And just as I'm giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one, it's so intoxicating
And being where I've been, I know that in the end
I'll do it all again
'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, love will find me, there ain't no denying
That you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh, oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Mmm
Oh-ooh
Told me, told me I'm your only
It's all unfoldin', babe
Slowly, slowly, lies you sold me
All saw the light of day
You been wastin' time on the other side
If you're satisfied, touché
Now you say you hate all the empty space
And if you could go back, you'd stay
Didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me outta your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now
It's cold out there, let me know what you found
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now
Chase me, chase me, that's right, baby
Yeah, feel the way it feels
When you don't havе control of who I'm holdin'
Is it feedin' all your fears?
You been wastin' time on the othеr side
If you're satisfied, touché
But the lights are off, 
your so-called friends are gone
Oh, I know what you're 'bout to say
Didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me outta your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now
It's cold out there, let me know what you found
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now
Didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me outta your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now
It's cold out there, let me know what you found
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now
I bet you wanna
I bet you wanna 
Bet you miss me, bet you're reminiscin'
I bet you hate the way that you said goodbye
And you still can't even tell me why
I hate the way that you left me dry
But I'll keep that between you and I
I bet you didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me outta your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now 
It's cold out there, let me know what you found
Bet you wanna love me now 
Bet you wanna love me now
 Our love is running into a burning building
 Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire
Rumors spread like wildfire
I held a strong ground
But I've been burning down
'Cause it's like fire is all I hear about
And we are fading out
Don't wanna turn out the light
But it's like...
I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm, and there goes the night
 Our love is running into a burning building
 Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire
Secrets in a small town, they always get around
But the flame has been put out
And I am hearing all the small talk
They whisper as I walk
In a house that's boarded up
So good luck
I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm, and there goes the night
 Our love is running into a burning building
 Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire
Smoke and fire, smoke and fire
Don't you know that if there's smoke, there's fire?
Smoke there's fire, smoke there's fire
Now, now
 And now it's over
 I'm getting colder
 And it's the feeling
Of running into a burning building
Rumors spread like wildfire
I held a strong ground
But I've been burning down
 Our love is running into a burning building
 Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire
Smoke and fire, smoke and fire
Don't you know that if there's smoke, there's fire?
Smoke there's fire, smoke there's fire
Now, now
 And now it's over
 I'm getting colder
 I'm so tired
Burning like smoke and fire
He's good for my heart, but he's bad for business
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby
We look good in photographs
I like the way you like to laugh
At dirty jokes, I know they'll always land
Used to get to work on time
But now you're takin' up my nights
Never been so glad to be so tired
Ooh, I'm mad for you
It's sad but true and I know it
Ah, you're on my mind
You stole my life and it's showin' 
He's good for my heart, but he's bad for business
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby
If I'm just writin' happy songs
Will anybody sing along?
You had to go and break into my head
And I would try to fight these feelings
I can't find a single reason
I'd make all the same mistakes again, ah
Ooh, I'm mad for you
It's sad but true and I know it
Ah, you're on my mind
You stole my life and it's showin'
He's good for my heart, but he's bad for business
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby
He's good , it's bad 
The best I've ever had 
And he's so nice, it's sad 
He ruined all my plans
And he just makes me so crazy
I know everyone sees
That he'll be the death of me
He's good for my heart, but he's bad for business 
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby
He's good for my heart, but he's bad for business 
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby

Little things become everything
When you wouldn't think that they would
Little things weigh so heavily
Take my energy ’til it's gone
I wanna be alone
But all these emotions won't leave me alone
I’m tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to stop the
Losing all control
Hypothetically, I could let it go easy
But I'm still, I'm still
I’m still, I’m still, I'm still in my bed about it
I’m still, I'm still, I'm still in my head about it
I'm not usually like this
I’m not usually like this
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed
Turn this pillowcase to the cooler side
Give me something I can feel 'cause I
Wanna turn a page, wanna rearrange
Swinging doors wide open in my mind, no
I wanna be alone 
But all these emotions won't leave me alone 
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to stop the
Losing all control 
But hypothetically, I could let it go easy
But I'm still, I'm still
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it 
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my head about it 
I'm not usually like this
I'm not usually like this
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it
Something chemical inside me messin' with my mind
And I can't help but feel like
I'm feeling like someone else 
Something animal inside me
Trying to remind me there's no need
To worry about it and lose myself
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it 
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my head about it 
I'm not usually like this 
I'm not usually like this 
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it
I'm still in my bed, I'm still in my bed 
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it 
I'm still in my bed, I'm still in my 
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed
If I fall in love with all my problems, will they leave me too?
Or maybe I believed in all your lies 'cause I believed in you
Why were you somewhere else when you were next to me?
I know you know it keeps me up
Did you think about her face with your hands around my waist?
Did you even give a fuck?
You can't spell "lonesome" without "me"
Mm, mm, mm
And there's no hope in misery
Mm, mm, mm
I can't escapе your history, oh
You can't spell "lonesome" without "mе"
You just can't
Tell me I was more than just a decent opportunity
Or will you tell me anything I wanna hear to control how you're perceived?
Why were you somewhere else when you were next to me?
I know you know it keeps me up
Isn't it kind of strange how it all changed when
I wasn't the one they wanted you to love?
You can't spell "lonesome" without "me"
Mm, mm, mm
And there's no hope in misery
Mm, mm, mm
I can't escape your history, oh
You can't spell "lonesome" without "me"
You just can't
Mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm
If you were a wise man, baby, you would drop
Every other ho, ho, ho and put me on top
Up there on your tree, better treat me like a star
Spend your cookie dough, dough, dough, spend it on my heart
Fuck the jet, send the sleigh
It's a packed holiday, and I got options, babe 
If you don't wanna buy me presents
Drink me like a warm glass of milk
If you're not gonna race here from the
North Pole to Beverly Hills
Just to keep my stockin' filled
Well, I know somebody who will 
Hе's a little bit older 
Got a bit of a dad bod
From a city that's colder 
But damn it, he's so hot
He knows when I'm sleepin' 
And he knows when I'm not
I haven't, like, seen him in a while
He's probably just busy at his workshop
Fuck the jet , send the sleigh 
It's a packed holiday, and I got options, babe 
If you don't wanna buy me presents
Drink me like a warm glass of milk 
If you're not gonna  race here from the
North Pole to Beverly Hills
Just to keep my stockin' filled 
Well, I know somebody who will
If you don't wanna buy me presents
Drink me like a warm glass of milk 
If you're not gonna  race here from the
North Pole to Beverly Hills
Just to keep my stockin' filled
Oh, I know somebody who will
I don't wanna buy what they're sellin' these days
Sayin' feelin' and fallin' is all a mistake
No, no
And why does everybody look at young hearts fillin' up
Like it's just a matter of time before they break?
No, no
They started sayin', "When you can't hide, run"
"When you can't run, hide"
Started thinkin' love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all stop thinkin' that the world
Stopped spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did a heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meaning it was worth the while?
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide
Traded out our eyes to light a screen
Traded our holdin' hands to holdin' back everything
No, no
No, no, oh
And words got shorter and quiet got longer
And all the sudden, love started lookin' like a memory
No, no, no
They started sayin', "If you can't hide, run"
"If you can't run, hide"
Started thinkin' love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all stop thinkin' that the world
Stopped spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did a heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meaning it was worth the while?
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide, no
Mmm, no
No, no, no
They started sayin', "When you can't hide, run"
"When you can't run, hide"
But love don't gotta be a loaded gun
Or a losin' fight
And when did we all stop thinkin' that the world
Stopped spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did a heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meaning it was worth the while?
But I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide
Ah
Done everything and done it again
Not every party needs our attendance
Don't take this as complaining
Just little rearrangements
All the nights that we've been takin'
Maybe we could take one off
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah (
I just wanna, I just wanna hold tight)
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Not like I wanna keep you inside, yeah
But I was hoping we could switch up how we're spending our time
Don't take this as complaining
Just little rearrangements
All the nights that we've been takin'
Maybe we could take one off
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah (
I just wanna, I just wanna hold tight)
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
[Verse 3: UHMEER & 
Sabrina Carpenter
]
I just want that hand hold with the sweat in the middle
Running down to when I feel alone and the feeling gone, you can touch it a little
Hear me underneath the covers coloring your body, reading Braille
Take you to Bahamas, seeping through the sand
Sucking on the silence, now I'm in your ear
Telling you, baby, to listen, I just
Wanna keep you in, wanna keep you in right
Wanna feel your skin, wanna feel it on mine
Maybe I been on the Internet forgetting how to keep it slow
But no, I need it bitty bad bone Bonnie Clyde, come and get it
I don't know, I get it, get it, I get it, oh
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out , we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah (
We keep going, we going
)
(
I just wanna, I just wanna hold tight
)
Always gotta go out , we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Santa
Doesn't know you like I do
I've been there through the good and bad
Know how to make you laugh
Kiss all your tears away, babe
Oh, only I can do that
Why don't you just come over?
You've been actin' so cold 
No, I don't want nothin' crazy

And all of the snow is fallin' 
I can make you fall too 
So tell me what's on your wish list
I wanna make it come true

Santa
Doesn't know you like I do
I know all of your favorite songs
Pick up each time you call
So why can't I be the one
To give you everything you want?
I just want you to tell me that you feel the same
I don't think I'm gonna make it through the winter, babe
Well, don't you wanna wrap me up and mistle-touch under the tree?
He won't bring you somebody that loves you more than me, yeah
Santa 
Doesn't know you like I do 
I've been there through the good and bad
Know how to make you laugh
Kiss all your tears away, babe
Oh, only I can do that 
Santa 
Doesn't know you like I do 
I know all of your favorite songs
Pick up each time you call
So why can't I be the one
To give you everything you want?
You're gonna leave me all alone? On Christmas?
Baby, what'd I ever do to deserve all that?
Can't we just, like, snuggle underneath the tree? By the fireplace?
You know I make those cookies you like
Santa
Doesn't know you like I do
Well, maybe this Christmastime
You'll finally realize
That I could be the one
To give you everything you want
I'm sick and tired of this holiday
Not good at bein' present anyway
The songs are catchy, but they're overplayed
My relatives always know what to say to piss me off
Small talk in the kitchen
Dated, dumb traditions
Who sucks competition 
Call it pessimism
December is a prison
It just makes me miss him
Is it New Year's yet?
I'm gettin' bored, so can we skip ahead?
I just wanna forget
That I'm at home with nobody to hold
I'm dreamin' 'bout silver and gold 
That champagne buzz down to my toes 
Someone, not you, kissin' me, oh yes
Nеw Year's, is it New Year's yеt?
Santa, Santa, boy, you're the worst
It's the 25th, I wish it was the 1st
Couples all around me, damn, it hurts
Wanna push 'em in the fireplace and watch 'em burn
Santa, Santa, why do you hate me?
I'm a gift, look how God made me
Never, never get what's on my list
Fruitcake just makes me sick 
Small talk in the kitchen
Dated, dumb traditions
Who sucks competition

Stackin' bills and counting change

We're picking fights, we're fully grown
How come we get so immature when we're alone?
I roll my eyes, you check your phone
You say I'm overly dramatic and I know
'Cause I wanna bring you to your knees
Begging for me now, begging for me
Push you to the edge to see
How far you're willing to reach
I'm slamming the door, but I'm staying
I make up my mind and I change it
It's you that I want when we're breaking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
I'm losing the game that I'm playing
Keep pulling me close 'cause I'm fading
Don't forget the words that I'm saying
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
 I'm faking
 I'm faking, oh
 I'm faking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
We go ego to ego, starting fires
Saying shit we don't mean, I mean we're liars
But the truth is we're messed up and we like it
Shut up, shut up, shut up
'Cause I wanna bring you to your knees
Begging for me now, begging for me
Push you to the edge to see
How far you're willing to reach, yeah
I'm slamming the door, but I'm staying
I make up my mind and I change it
It's you that I want when we're breaking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
I'm losing the game that I'm playing
Keep pulling me close 'cause I'm fading
Don't forget the words that I'm saying
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
 I'm faking
 I'm faking, oh
 I'm faking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
I wanna bring you to your knees
Begging for me now 
I wanna see how far you're willing to reach, yeah
I'm slamming the door, but I'm staying 
I make up my mind and I change it 
It's you that I want when we're breaking 
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
I'm losing the game that I'm playing 
Keep pulling me close 'cause I'm fading 
Don't forget the words that I'm saying
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
 I'm faking
 I'm faking, oh
 I'm faking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
La-di-da-da-da-na
Yeah
Everybody loves to tell me
I was born an old soul
Better keep my eyes wide open
There's so much that I don't know
Just another hotel room
Never felt so all alone
I think about my granddad's eyes
And they always send me home
I can almost hear him now
I gotta make him proud
I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground, unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open
I can't see two steps ahead of me
When the fog comes rollin' in
I never thought I'd miss the rain
Lord knows how long it's been
This dream burns inside of me
And I can't just let it go
There's still so much that I don't know
I keep my eyes wide open 
Bless this ground, unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open 
All I have is just this moment
I don't wanna miss a second
'Cause it could all be gone in an instant
Yeah, in an instant
I keep my eyes wide open 
Bless this ground, unbroken 
I'm about to make my way 
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open
I keep my eyes wide open
You're not asking for much, but
It just seems like a lot, and
Kinda confused, don't know what to choose
But baby, it's hard for me, I'm not ready for your love
I keep on the go, but
I don't mean to tease ya
You're down on your knees, you're beggin' me please
But darling, it's not the way to get me, baby, no
Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think we could be a thing
And I'd give you everything, love
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
We can't get the timing
Because I was running
But now I want you and you always knew
So baby, you pull away and make me wait for you
So screw all that love ish
I think that I've had it
The more you turn your back, then I want you back
'Cause this is the last time I play this game
Always the same and I'm through
Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think we could be a thing
And I'd give you everything, love
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes 
Sometimes
'Cause love feels like loneliness sometimes
Love feels like loneliness 
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes 
Sometimes, sometimes 
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes 
Said there's nothing that we can't do when we're dancing
I can feel the music more when I'm with you
With your hands on me, I feel my heartbeat racing
Now
Had to let go of everything that I'd known
Before-ore-ore
One, two, three, come with me
We can work it differently
One, two, three, and dance with me tonight 
And, baby, all our dreams are comin' true
And, baby, I can feel you feel it too
So just let me move you 
One, two, three, yeah, come with me
We can work it differently
Said one, two, three, and dance with me tonight 
And, baby, all our dreams are comin' true
And, baby, I can feel you feel it too
So just let me move you, let me move you
Yeah, little faster, little slower, it don't matter
'Cause I've never known myself this good 'til now
And I hope you know this change in me's forever
Forever
Had to let go of everything that I'd known
Before-ore-ore 
One, two, three, come with me
We can work it differently
One, two, three, and dance with me tonight 
And, baby, all our dreams are comin' true
And, baby, I can feel you feel it too

We can work it differently
Said one, two, three, and dance with me tonight 
And, baby, all our dreams are comin' true
And, baby, I can feel you feel it too
So just let me move you, let me move you
We all got nightmares in our dreams
We look for someone to believe in us
And show us the way, and make it okay
The world can be dangerous
There's something so rare in your veins
Not a single thing I would change
And oh, if you only knew how I see you
Would you come alive again, 'live again?
I, I
I need you to understand
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
I don't mind your shadows
Your shadows, baby, I don't
Pictures in our head
Of what we're supposed to be, measuring ourselves
But where is the love? Where is the love?
The world got us wonderin', wonderin'
I, I
I need you to understand
That I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows
Your shadows, baby, I don't
And all these voices in our head
Well, they keep screamin' louder and louder
But they won't pull us under
And baby, I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows
Your shadows, baby, I don't
Aw sh
it
Got me in my feelings, mmm
What the hell you doing to me?
I can't help what I'm feeling
Yeah, 'cause I'm fallin' down like a summer rain
People askin' what we doin', I don't say a thing
Can we keep it to ourselves like if it's all the same?
'Cause if they know what we know
That's when everything's gonna change
Should we tell 'em? Mmm
It might be too much for them, they might get jealous, hey
The way that you're lifting me up, feel like heaven, oh
I know they can see it, I know they can tell it
So we ain't gotta tell 'em 
We ain't gotta tell
Tell 'em nothing, no, tell 'em, tell 'em, no 
Tell 'em nothing, no, we tell 'em, tell 'em nothing 
We ain't gotta tell 'em, tell 
Ain't no reason why we need to tell nobody
We don't gotta give it any labels
Cards already on the table
And we don't need opinions in our head space
You and me already in a good place
Like whoa, stay, let's keep it this way
People askin' what we doin', I don't say a thing, no
Can we keep it to ourselves like if it's all the same?
'Cause if they know what we know
That's when everything's gonna change
Should we tell 'em? Mmm
It might be too much for them, they might get jealous, hey
The way that you're lifting me up, feel like heaven, oh
I know they can see it, I know they can tell it
So we ain't gotta tell 'em 
We ain't gotta tell 'em
No, tell 'em, tell 'em, no 
Tell, tell 'em nothing, no, we tell 'em, tell 'em nothing 
We ain't gotta tell 'em, tell 
You could be my dirty little secret
And you could be my everything I'm needing
And you could be my dirty little secret 
Nobody has to know 
We ain't gotta tell 'em
No, babe, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, no 
Tell 'em nothing, no, we tell 'em, tell 'em nothing 
We ain't gotta tell 'em nothing, babe
We ain't gotta tell 'em, baby, no 
We ain't gotta tell nothin' to no one
We ain't gotta tell nothin' to no one
We ain't gotta tell
Tell 'em nothing, no, tell 'em, tell 'em, no 
You know, you know
Tell 'em nothing, no, we tell 'em, tell 'em nothing 
We ain't gotta tell 'em, tell 
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell 'em nothing, ain't got to tell
We ain't got to tell 'em nothing, ain't got to tell
We ain't got to tell 'em nothing, ain't got to tell
We ain't got to tell 'em nothing
I hope we stay the same, hey
Honeymoon
Unexpected, this thing that we fell into
Like, so connected
You came at a time when my heart was selective
Didn't have to choose, my love was accepted, yeah
Now I'm learning you like 101
You were sent to me like a one of one
And now we're going hard, just one on one
Nobody else
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope that we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades
After the honeymoon fades, yeah
Now remember when we met, we was all in each other's bed
And we were spending every second we had
And now that it's official, it's hittin' a little different
What the hell we gonna do with these bags? No, yeah
And now I'm learning you like 101
You were sent to me like a one of one
And now we're going hard, just one on one
Nobody else
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope that we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades 
After the honeymoon fades
And I hope it tastes the same, mmm
Even if it's bittersweet
Honeymoon fading with you 
Honeymoon fading with you 
Honeymoon fading with you 
Honeymoon fading, fading
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Keep it casual, don't have to tippy-toe
Take your cares off, just stay a couple more
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Go and get a little closer
Playing mind games, we don't do that here
So put your bid in before I disappear
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Come and get a little closer
Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay?
Yeah, yeah
Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you
Wasting your time, should be making that move
Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa
What's on my mind, I've been thinking maybe
I could be yours by the time that we leave
Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh
I know your type, what's with the timid behavior?
You let this ooh-la-la-la intimidate ya
Don't you make me, don't you make me leave on my own
I'm already ready, come on
Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay?
Yeah, yeah
Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you
Wasting your time, should be making that move
Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa
What's on my mind, I've been thinking maybe
I could be yours by the time that we leave
Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh no
You can get real close, talkin', you talkin' now
Underneath our clothes, pretend that we know it all
Shut off the lights just to hide in the dark
 Dark,  dark
Think that I know you the farther you are
 No
Like A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kind of thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess
Like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need
See right through the fiction and all of this fakery
Just give me some friction, let me see what nobody sees
You don't think that I can handle the truth
Baby, I'm over just playing it cool, no
Like A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kind of thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess
Like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need
That's what we need 
That's what we need 
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?
That's what we need
That's what we need
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need
That's what we need, that's what we need
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?
That's what we need, that's what we need
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time
You never finish your glass, take a little sip and you're bored
Down in the apartment below, wouldn't even open your door
You said, "It's a bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time" 
Too many times, I've asked myself, "What did I come here for?"
Now I know you wanna talk about it, talk about it, yeah
Suddenly, you're into me again
Let's talk about it, talk about it, yeah

Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time
You should know about it by now
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time

You were sittin' comfortable and I was busy kissin' your floor
Now I know you wanna talk about it, talk about it, yeah
Suddenly, you're into me again
Let's talk about it, talk about it, yeah
I've been dyin' to use the line

And every time is probably gonna be a bad time 
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
When you were callin' me and hopin' for a good time
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time

Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time

La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, yeah
You should know about it by now
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone together
Oh, I could really like it
Maybe we could carve it in the woods
Oh, Florence in the spring time
Love me in the meantime, wish you would
But if we're all alone in a crowded room
Maybe we could be alone, just me and you
Baby, if you jump, then I'll jump too
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone together
Oh, strangers in the nighttime
There's never a right time to say "Hello"
Yeah, everyone's your best friend 'til you get to know them
But I know you
And if we're all alone in a crowded room
Maybe we could be alone, just me and you
Baby, if you jump, then I'll jump too
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone together
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone
We could be alone
We could be alone together
Hope I never see you in the right light 
Hope I always catch you at the wrong time 
If you let me take a picture of your bad side 
And you like it, well, that's a good sign, hey 
I know you're not a fan of double texting 
But you don't always gotta leave me guessing 
I know you wanna leave a good impression
But you did it, you did without tryin', oh yeah
I like your soul when it's shirtless
'Cause it's just like mine
I like your hands when they're nervous
And they're all over mine, like yeah
Show me under the surface 
And we can cross that line 
When you stop acting perfect
Baby, take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take it all off
We could even kick it in the driveway 
'Cause you know I'm not tryna over-complicate
If showin' all your colors led to heartbreak 
Then let it break on me, yeah, yeah
I like your soul when it's shirtless
'Cause it's just like mine
I like your hands when they're nervous
And they're all over mine, like yeah
Show me under the surface 
And we can cross that line 
When you stop acting perfect
Baby, take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take it all off
Don't play hard to get 
Be hard to forget 
Don't play hard to get, no 
Don't play hard to get 
Be hard to forget 
Don't play hard to get 
Baby, take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take it all off
When you take it all off 
When you take it all off 
Baby, I'll take off mine too
When you take off all your cool 
When you take it all off 
When you take it all off 
Baby, I'll take off mine too
Ooh
Woah
Woah-oh
If I smile, dancing alone for a while
Oh-woah, would you rescue me?
And if I fall, hoping it's in your arms
I know, know, know you'll rescue me
Ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da
Woah-woah-woah, darling, please rescue me
Ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da
Woah-woah-woah, won't you please rescue me?
Give your heart, baby, just ease your mind
To see that it's meant to be
'Cause when I'm with you, darling, it's such a breeze
That I know, know you'll rescue me
Ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da 
Woah-woah-woah, darling, please rescue me 
Ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da
Woah-woah-woah, won't you please rescue me?
Mmm-mmm
And honey, if you see me drowning
Baby, fish me out, I'm falling
I just need a voice for calling
And can't you see I trust you always?
So I will linger 'til you know
That I will never let you go
If you rescue me
If I smile, dancing alone for a while
Oh-woah, would you rescue me?
And if I fall, hoping it's in your arms
I know, know, know you'll rescue me
I picked you out 'cause you were shiny and new
Had all the features, even came with tattoos
But I just figured out now what hindsight means
Up until now, never had any reason to
Wish that I didn't, but now I do
The hell do I do with all these receipts?
Every moment that I ever spent on you
Shoulda just bought a new pair of shoes
I wanna take you back, take you back, oh
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
I wanna take you back, take you back, I
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
I wanna put you back, na-na
Closest I've ever come to buyer's remorse
If you don't make me happy, then what good are you for?
But I just figured out now what hindsight means
Up until now, never had any reason to
Wish that I didn't, but now I do
The hell do I do with all these receipts?
Every moment that I ever spent on you
Shoulda just bought a new pair of shoes
I wanna take you back, take you back, oh
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
I wanna take you back, take you back, I
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, rid of it
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, say it again 
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, rid of it
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, say it again
I wanna take you back, take you back, oh 
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
I wanna take you back, take you back, I
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
I wanna put you back where I found you
Back to where you came from
No, no, no, no, no, oh hey 
I wanna take you back, oh no 
Ah-la-la-la-la, ah-na-na-na-na-na
We are young, we are gold
Trying things we didn't know
Looking at the sky
See it come alive
All our fears became our hopes
Climbed out every locked window
We rode a lion's mane
And fell upon the rain
We can reach the constellations
Trust me, all our dreams are breaking out
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
Yeah, all we really need is us
Don't be scared to close your eyes
No, we're never gonna die
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close our eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
Let me in, hold me close
Fill my heart with simple notes
So when it's hard to see
They are there reminding me
Take my breath and hold me high
So I can feel the city lights
Glowing under me
It's in our reach, we're breaking out
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
Yeah, all we really need is us
Don't be scared to close your eyes
No, we're never gonna die
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close our eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
We can reach the constellations
Trust me, all our dreams are breaking out
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
All we really need is us
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close our eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
Woah, we'll be the stars
No words, no words, no words
When everything is quiet
Nothing on the tip of your tongue
But a beautiful silence
And it lets me know
That even in the madness
When everything just seems to go wrong
Take a beautiful silence
'Cause it lets me know
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
When I'm in the darkness
The dawn is having you by my side
'Cause you leave me speechless
And it lets me know
Where nobody can hear us
I'll tell you everything with my eyes
'Cause you leave me speechless
And I think you know
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words
No, no, no
No words
No, no
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue 
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart 
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
Baby, no words, no words, no words
They could tear this house down brick by brick
But we won't even miss a thing
They said we'd never make it, but our hearts won't quit
A never-ending fantasy
We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love, na
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love, na
We don't need a dream to be wide awake
When every day is ecstasy
We won't let the stars cross, change our fate
It's heaven when you're next to me
We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love, na
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love, na
They could tear this house down brick by brick
But we won't even miss a thing
They said we'd never make it, but our hearts won't quit
A never-ending fantasy
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love, na
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love
'Cause all we have is love
'Cause all we have is love, na
They said, "You can't wear Giamba
Baby, you gotta pay"
Well, then we got a problem, problem
"And there's a party at midnight at the top of the hill
But you gotta be someone, someone"
And every face is a hologram
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent
It's all part of the scene, oh
Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?
And we just go through the motions
Yeah, we lock 'em inside
Don't show any emotion, emotion
And everybody's been talking
Believe it or not
But you don't gotta listen, listen
And every face is a hologram
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent
It's all part of the scene, oh
Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?
Is it real, is it real or not?
Is it real, everything we've got?
I don't know
And is it real, is it real or not?
Is it real, everything we've got? Ooh
Or is it just a mirage? 
All these Hollywood gods 
And everything that we've got 
Is it just a mirage?
Is it just a mirage?
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Cast out to sea
Drifting with the tide
And no way of finding me
Now that I'm free
Nothing but blue skies
Paradise in front of me
Awake from this dream
I hold my breath and just believe
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn 'em into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Alone in a room
Tearing down the walls
Painting over scars and bruises
Now this is home
Fill it up with love
And make the best of something new, yeah
As hard as it seems
I hold my breath and just believe
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn 'em into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
The colors and the stars seem a little brighter
Tomorrow isn't far away 
Through the hardest part
I'm working towards a happy ending
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on fate, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn 'em into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn 'em into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I'm dreamin' of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow, mmm
Da-da-da-dum, da-da, da-da-dum
Da-da-da-dum, da-da, da-da-dum
I said
I'm dreamin' of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write, oh-oh
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all  your  Christmases be 
White 
Da-da-da, oh
'Cause I'm dreamin' of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Jingle bells, the jingle bеlls
Jingle all the way
Ooh
You are the voice inside my mind
Something so real is hard to find
I know, I know 
I know, I know 
I'll hold you tight, remove the air
No space between, I want you here
I know, I know 
Baby, you're home
Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time
We're livin' for tonight
You give me a reason
To feel what I feel
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer
To all of my fears
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You got my heart, I don't want it back
This moment can't be washed away
A part of you's a part of me
I know, I know 
I know, I know 
This love we have will never end
We're circles, we begin again
I know, I know
Baby, I'm home
Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time, no
We're livin' for tonight, oh
You give me a reason 
To feel what I feel 
When everything is under attack 
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer
To all of my fears 
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You give me a reason 
You give me a feeling 
And all of the things you're givin' to me
You're givin' to me, baby
You give me a reason
To feel what I feel 
When everything is under attack 
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer 
To all of my fears 
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
Don't want it back, no, baby
You got my heart, I don't want it back
No, no, no, no, no, no
You got my heart, I don't want it back
Good morning, you're leaving
I'll see you in the evening
My best friend 'til the end
My better half, no pretend
Our language is sacred
Though people try to solve it
New adventures on the way
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah, we're seamless
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're klutzy, but so lucky
That I always have you to catch me
We're partners in crime
You're stuck with me your whole life
So different, out of our minds
From a planet that's hard to find
Every second every day
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah, we're seamless
You're right by my side whenever I need you
Through the hardest times, I'll be there for you
At the crack of dawn when the moon is gone
I won't be hard to find
'Cause you and me, oh yeah, we're seamless
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah, we're seamless
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Under pressure 
Questions all around, but there's no answers 
Try to keep my pace, they want it faster 
Records all around, they give me shelter, shelter 
Oh, no
No need to hurry, no need to rush
I tell them my story, it's never enough
I'm hiding from my shadows
Running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom
I need some room to breathe
But I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
So gimme a little, gimme a little, a little more space
Just gimme a little, gimme a little 
Satisfaction 
All we ever want, but I can't have it 
Scribbles on the page, they call it magic 
Makes me wanna be what you imagine, imagine
No
No need to hurry 
No need to rush 
I tell them my story, it's never enough
I'm hiding from my shadows
Running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom
I need some room to breathe
But I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
Gimme, gimme, gimme space
Gimme, gimme, gimme space
Gimme, gimme, gimme space 
Gimme, gimme, gimme space
Space
I'm hiding from my shadows
Running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom
I need some room to breathe 
But I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me 
I'm hiding from my shadows
I know that you are watching 
I need a taste of freedom 
Gimme some room to breathe
But I know that you are watching 
You're right there watching me 
Just give me some space
Just give me some space
A little more
Just give me some space, baby
Big lights, people
Rushing to grow up before you know
Stop signs, denied
Everyone tells me I gotta go slow
And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But nothing can change my mind
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
Raindrops, deep thoughts
Pictures of you and me wherever I go
Laughing, running
To a place where nobody says no
It's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But I've got to fall to fly, yeah
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
'Cause I'm not too young, no
Yeah
And if I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
And if I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
'Cause I'm not too young, no
'Cause I'm not too young
I'm played out, it's late out
I'm really hoping you don't care
This pent up momentum
You're starting to become aware
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
It's all there, it's not fair
Where will our hearts be when it's done?
When night falls, and you don't call
I'll stay up waiting for the sun
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
I had the upper hand
But I, I, I
I had the upper hand
But I
O-oh
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
Ta-da-da-ta, ta-ta
I'm a grass-fed, free-range, non-GMO shit
Gluten-free, wagyu beef, au naturel bitch
You pick me up, you'll never wanna put me down
I promise you that you'll be singing out loud
Happy birthday to you
I'm the prize, baby, you can't lose
It's up to you, honey, you choose
I said, "I'm right, all ready if you're ready for me," uh
I eat food with my hands
Do the Cha-Cha when I dance
I'm no good at making plans 
Fresh face, little waist
I can put you in your place
Freak in the sheets, at the movies, and back at your place
You should thank God the heavens designed me
You noticin' it when you walk by me
You say, "What's that? It's rеally nice
Wearin' this shit my whole lifе
What's that material?" Oh, yeah, it's wife
Da, da-da, yeah
I'm a diamond and the facet
Hit your balance and your assets
Your friends kiss your accent
I'm a girl with many talents
Your newest, baddest habit
When I leave, you wish you hadn't
Happy birthday to you
Say, I'm the prize, baby, you can't lose
It's up to you, honey, you choose
I said, "I'm right, all ready if you're ready for me," uh
I eat food with my hands
Do the Cha-Cha when I dance
I'm no good at making plans 
Fresh face, little waist
I can put you in your place
Freak in the sheets, at the movies, and back at your place
You should thank God the heavens designed me
You noticin' it when you walk by me
You say, "What's that? It's really nice
Wearin' this shit my whole life
What's that material?" Oh, yeah, it's wife
Da, da-da, yeah
Ah-ta-da-da, da-da
Here comes your life
Dressed in something nice, yeah
Oh, yeah, it's wife
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Sometimes life gets bitter
I get strung out, caught in the middle
And I can't breathe
I just need a little taste of paradise
I know a place I can escape to
Where I go, troubles never break through
The grass is greener, my head is clearer
I got peace of mind
When I fall into your eyes
Your love's like breathing in the salty air of summer
On a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinnin' in my head
Keep it play-playin' on repeat
It's like flowers in the springtime
Every day is Valentine's
So good, it's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight
Dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
Woah-oh, woah-oh
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
Woah-oh, woah-oh
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
Stop signs I keep on running into
Red lights make me wanna scream like
Why can't it just be only you and me
All the time? 
In a world no one can find
Your love's like breathing in the salty air of summer
On a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinnin' in my head
Keep it play-playin' on repeat
It's like flowers in the springtime
Every day is Valentine's
So good, it's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight
Dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
Woah-oh, woah-oh
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
Woah-oh, woah-oh
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
When life has left me numb
And I need a pick-me-up
There's no better rush than your love
Your love, your love
Your love's like breathing in the salty air of summer
On a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinnin' in my head
Keep it play-playin' on repeat
It's like walking on the ceiling
Can't compare the feeling
Better than I could ever describe
It's like soakin' in the sunrise
Not a worry on my mind 
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
Woah-oh, woah-oh 
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
Woah-oh, woah-oh 
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
Woah-oh, woah-oh
That's what your love , that's what your love's like
Woah-oh, woah-oh
That's what your love's like
Take, take it all away
Save my heart for another day
I'm up late on the telephone
And I'm all alone with a dial tone
Wait, wait 'til the sun is up
Drown my dreams in a coffee cup
Palms out, wanna beg for luck
But I'm way too proud, never giving up
Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give
And something's got to break
I know someday, it's gonna happen
Someday, it's gonna give
Can't always be this way
And if the riptide comes to get me
Pulls me under, won't upset me
I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag, I'll surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now
Give, give everything I've got
Out of reach, but I'll take a shot
Kick rocks in the parking lot
Feel like giving up, but I'll never stop
Run, run, running like a fool
Never win if you never lose
And find hope in a little truth
Wanna learn new tricks, gotta jump through hoops
Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give
And something's got to break
I know someday, it's gonna happen
Someday, it's gonna give
Can't always be this way
And if the riptide comes to get me
Pulls me under, won't upset me
I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag, I'll surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever
Not forever, won't stay down
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever
Not forever, won't stay down
And if the riptide comes to get me
Pulls me under, won't upset me
I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag, I'll surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now
And if the riptide comes to get me
Pulls me under, won't upset me
I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag, I'll surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now
Na-na-na-na-na
It's a narrow line I'm walking
Better watch my step
'Cause we got everybody talking
And I can hear 'em say
Maybe in another lifetime 
Maybe when you're older
What they don't know is
I've already made up my mind 
And yes, I know what love is
'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls with two young hearts
Two young hearts
They say we're too young
I could lie awake in darkness
Oh, just to dream of you
And you can lay your head on my chest
Yeah, just like you always do
Maybe in another lifetime 
Maybe when we're older
At least we know that
We've already made up our minds 
And yes, we know what love is
'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls with two young hearts
Two young hearts, oh
We're gonna keep on runnin'
Runnin' for all that we are
We want it all or nothin'
We knew it right from the start
We are a part of somethin'
Somethin' as old as time, time, time
'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls with two young hearts
Two young hearts
You're never too young
Dandelions are going to seed
It's my soul I need to feed
Trees stand so tall and bare
And here I stand without a care
Pumpkin seeds stuck in my teeth
There's something more I need to be
More than just a silly girl
Waiting for the sun to hurl
Rays of sunlight
Down the sidewalk, down on me
Casting light on
The turning leaves and what I'm supposed to see
Winter's here and settled in
But where are you? I can't begin
To imagine where I went wrong
Perhaps it was when I started this song
Rays of sunlight
Reflecting off the snowflakes
There are no more crinkly leaves
I need to rake
There's a chance
A chance I need to take
Birds and bees are here again
We haven't talked since God knows when
I like to dance in the sprouting grass
If it snows again, then I'll have to ask
Why the hell are
The seasons fickle just like you?
Rip my heart in half
I'll stitch it up if it's certain we are through
Junebugs, butterflies, sand in my pants
Midnight moon and those pesky little ants
You're here once more to try your luck
Well, I'm done with you, you sneaky little
Now it's over
There's nothing left for us to do
Besides acknowledging the repelling forces
That are me and you
We'll never be as young as we are right now
We'll never see the world like we do right now
So take in what's around you, put your camera down
Take a shot, give it all you got
I have a way of getting stuck on yesterday
I tend to miss the little things that come my way
Always looking forward, always looking back
They seem so near, but they're not here
'Cause time moves on so quickly
Without or with me
I've got to take a breath
And slow down, slow down, my mind is racing
Catch up, catch up, I've gotta pace myself
I'm always wandering, but I don't need to go right now
Let go, let go , we hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin  to live your life
The present is our future past
We've gotta make this moment last right now
Have you ever noticed how your heartbeat feels
When you're nervous or excited 'cause it's getting real?
Have you stopped to listen to what's in your soul?
That's your intuition and it always knows
Time moves on so quickly
Without or with me
I've got to take a breath
And slow down, slow down, my mind is racing
Catch up, catch up, I've gotta pace myself
I'm always wandering, but I don't need to go right now
Let go, let go , we hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin  to live your life
The present is our future past
We've gotta make this moment last right now
Oh, right now , right now 
Enjoy the ride, the ride that you're on
Right now, right now
Yeah
Let go, let go, we hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin to live your life
The present is our future past
We've gotta make this moment last right now
Ooh-oh, mmm
This might be wrong, but he's all I know
He's all I know
Most times, I pretend that he's just a friend
He's just a friend
Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss
Your lips I'll miss 'cause they're all I know
I can't let you go
And I won't forget all that you said
It's engraved in my head
Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss
No, a goodbye kiss, no
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine
But darling, I'm a mess without your love 
Heaven knows I'm trying , I'm trying to get by
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss 
So what if I just wanna be
A little bit out of my mind?
I let you take my heart and I like it
So what if I happen to be
A little bit out of my mind?
I bet I'll steal your heart and you'll like it
And I don't think it's any kind of secret
I feel you from a million miles away
And your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing, the best thing that I got
Mmm, mmm
I know sometimes, it seems like I
Am just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it
And sometimes, I can tell that I 
Am just a little out of time
I make you skip a beat and I know it
But I don't think it's any kind of secret
I think of you a billion times a day
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing, the best thing that I got
So don't feel lonely tonight
You know I'll never be hard to find
So don't go out of your mind
You know I'll never be too hard to find
I know sometimes, it seems like I
Am just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop 
It's the best thing, the best thing that I got
Your love is the best thing
And it's only just begun
It's the best thing
