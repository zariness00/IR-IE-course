Sabrina Carpenter,Please Please Please,Short n’ Sweet (Deluxe),"[Verse 1]
I know I have good judgment, I know I have good taste
It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
But just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby

[Chorus]
Please, please, please
Don't prove I'm right
And please, pleasе, please
Don't bring me to tеars when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)

[Verse 2]
Well, I have a fun idea, babe (Uh-huh), maybe just stay inside
I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice (It's so nice, right?)
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really (Kinda), really, really


[Chorus]
Please, please, please (Please don't prove I'm right)
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing (Heartbreak is one thing), my ego's another (Ego's another)
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)

If you wanna go and be stupid
Don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically

Sabrina Carpenter,Bed Chem,Short n’ Sweet (Deluxe),"[Verse 1]
I was in a sheer dress the day that we met
We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec
Your friend hit me up so we could connect
And what are the odds? You send me a text
And now the next thing I know, I'm like
Manifest that you're oversized
I digress, got me scrollin' like
Out of breath, got me goin' like

On a Tuesday, send a soft ""hey""

Found God at your ex's house, always

You're so dumb and poetic
It's just what I fall for, I like the aesthetic
Every self-help book, you've already read it
Cherry-pick lines like they're words you invented
Gold star for highbrow manipulation
And ""love everyone"" is your favorite quotation
Try to come off like you're soft and well-spoken
Jack off to lyrics by Leonard Cohen

Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you talk like one doesn't make you a man

You're so sad there's no communication
But, baby, you put us in this situation
You're running so fast from the hearts that you're breakin'
Save all your breath for your floor meditation
You're so empathetic, you'd make a great wife
And I promise the mushrooms aren't changing your life
Well, you crashed the car and abandoned the wreckage
Fuck with my head like it's some kind of fetish

You showed up with a boombox and stars in your eyes
Who knew cuddling on trampolines could be so reckless?
We bonded over Black Eyed Peas and complicated exes

Fell so deeply into it
It was all so innocent

[Chorus]
Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked

I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy

Ah, mmm

I'm not catastrophizing, everything's derailing
Was only tryna hold you close while your heart was failing

Meeting you as the glass-half-full version of me

It's times like these, wish I had a time machine
So I could see what you did October 13th
At 10:15, were you really asleep?
Were you lyin' to me and the family?
There's no ""us"" in us when I'm lackin' trust
You wanna discuss, ugh, you disgust me
Don't make me cuss you out, why'd you let me down?
Don't say sorry now
And thanks to you, I, I can't love right
I get nice guys and villainize them
Read their texts like they're havin' sex right now
Scared I'll find out that it's true
And if I do, then I blame you
For every worst that I assume
When I'm forty-five, someone calls me their wife
And he fucks our lives in one selfish night
Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did
And God, I love you, but you're such a dipshit
Please fuckin' fix this

Sabrina Carpenter,Vicious,emails i can’t send fwd:,"[Verse 1]
One year, ten thousand bad moments
But it was dressed up in heated emotion
And I tried to look for the best in the worst
But like, fuck me, that caused a commotion
You're lucky I'm a private person
I've quietly carried your burden
And everyone thinks you're an angel
But shit, I would probably use different wordin'

[Chorus]
Oh, you're so vicious
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Crush my heart and wreck my image
Why you gotta be so vicious?

You like a certain type of woman
Who's smart, but neglects intuition
When you're insecure, could be me, could be her
You just run to whoever is winnin' (Ah)

Now you're kinda acting like I died

I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch

Need to know if you're just a friend
Are you a secret I'm holdin' in?

The paranoia is sinkin' in
So leave it on my brain if you feel the same

Sabrina Carpenter,Can’t Blame a Girl for Trying,Eyes Wide Open ,"[Verse 1]
Here I am again, the same old situation
Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated?
I should've played it cool, instead, I made a fool
Oh, the things I do

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh, oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I should've shut my mouth, I could've kept it quiet
I might have freaked him out 'cause I was so excited
But I just couldn't wait, I took a leap of faith
Oh, the things I say

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love

And I think sometimes
I tend to be my own worst enemy
And maybe someday
I'm gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue
Doing what I do

And just as I'm giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one, it's so intoxicating
And being where I've been, I know that in the end
I'll do it all again

And we don't need opinions in our head space
You and me already in a good place

Can we keep it to ourselves like if it's all the same?
'Cause if they know what we know
That's when everything's gonna change

Should we tell 'em? Mmm
It might be too much for them, they might get jealous, hey

No, tell 'em, tell 'em, no (Tell 'em)
Tell, tell 'em nothing, no, we tell 'em, tell 'em nothing (Tell 'em)
We ain't gotta tell 'em, tell (Tell 'em)

Shoulda just bought a new pair of shoes

If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young

[Verse 2]
Raindrops, deep thoughts
Pictures of you and me wherever I go
Laughing, running
To a place where nobody says no


[Pre-Chorus]
It's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But I've got to fall to fly, yeah

[Chorus]
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm not too young, no
Yeah

[Chorus]
And if I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
And if I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
'Cause I'm not too young, no

[Verse]
How's it going over there in your own universe?
Do you like the colors that you're painting in your world?
Is it easier to stay inside and not get hurt?
Is the weather kind of dreary there without your girl?

[Pre-Chorus]
Always talking to yourself, are you still happy?
Is it heaven, is it hell, in there without me?
You've got your space and dust
But don't you still need love?

[Chorus]
If no one's there
To hear you scream
You can still reach out
Your hand to me
And I'm floating there
I'll always be
The brightest star in your galaxy",
Sabrina Carpenter,Your Love’s Like,Eyes Wide Open ,"[Intro]
Woah-oh, woah-oh

[Verse 1]
Sometimes life gets bitter
I get strung out, caught in the middle
And I can't breathe
I just need a little taste of paradise
I know a place I can escape to
Where I go, troubles never break through
The grass is greener, my head is clearer
I got peace of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
When I fall into your eyes

[Chorus]
Your love's like breathing in the salty air of summer
On a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinnin' in my head
Keep it play-playin' on repeat
It's like flowers in the springtime
Every day is Valentine's
So good, it's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight
Dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love, that's what your love's like


[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh, woah-oh
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
Woah-oh, woah-oh

Stop signs I keep on running into
Red lights make me wanna scream like
Why can't it just be only you and me
All the time? (All the time)

In a world no one can find

Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinnin' in my head

It's like walking on the ceiling
Can't compare the feeling
Better than I could ever describe
It's like soakin' in the sunrise
Not a worry on my mind (On my mind)

Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to ""Don't Leave Me Alone""
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like ""bleh-blah-blee""
I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me (Me)

I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me

Yeah, this boy got me goin' crazy (Yeah)
We just started dating, now he say he want a baby (Uh?)
He said, ""Coi, you so amazing
You a freak in the sheets and the streets, you such a lady""
He like when I'm talkin' pop shit
It's your bedtime, come and lay up in it (In it)
You just gonna blame it on the Goose (Goose)
Come take off these Jimmy Choos (Sheesh)
Yeah, dim the lights, got me in my mood
Fuckin' in Italy, Moulin Rouge
Sex on the flight and we breakin' all the rules (Yeah)
Soon as I land, I'ma need a round two (Let's go)
He lovin' this body (Body)
Coi Leray, you know I'm a problem (Uh-huh)
He want to come through and solve it, just miss me with the toxic

Take, take it all away
Save my heart for another day
I'm up late on the telephone
And I'm all alone with a dial tone
Wait, wait 'til the sun is up
Drown my dreams in a coffee cup
Palms out, wanna beg for luck
But I'm way too proud, never giving up

Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give
And something's got to break
I know someday, it's gonna happen
Someday, it's gonna give
Can't always be this way

And if the riptide comes to get me
Pulls me under, won't upset me
I'll go down

I'll throw the white flag, I'll surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now

[Verse 2]
Give, give everything I've got
Out of reach, but I'll take a shot
Kick rocks in the parking lot
Feel like giving up, but I'll never stop
Run, run, running like a fool
Never win if you never lose
And find hope in a little truth
Wanna learn new tricks, gotta jump through hoops

Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give
And something's got to break
I know someday, it's gonna happen
Someday, it's gonna give

Never heard a bird sing
Never let somebody call me baby
Never woke up in the morning with that hungry feeling
Would've said falling is weak
Wouldn't switch up my plans in a blink
Wouldn't catch me crying at the movies, no no

No nights staring at the moon
No song ever felt this true, mmm

Why is it that
I would get on a plane
Just to go grab some dinner
And stare at your face
I just thought of it now
'Cause it's starting to rain
I remember the days
Where you'd do the same

No sky ever looked so blue
No nights staring at the moon
No song ever felt so true, mmm

Hello, my name is Jenny Parker and these kids are my crew
We're in a lot of trouble and I'm not sure what to do
See it all started, when our phones made a switch
Lola lied to the parents, she's been a real witch
Kid snuck out, the kitchen caught fire
The car got towed, all because she's a liar

[BOBBY]
Now these bad guys are chasing us

[KATY]
We almost just died

I got a tattoo

This girl is ruining my life, my job, my reputation
And if we ever get home, I'm gonna need a vacation

The kid snuck out, I didn't have a clue

[ZAC]
Yeah, That's true

[LOLA]
Okay I admit it, I don't follow rules
I'm not good with kids, I'm not good at school
It wasn't my plan to steal a car
Or end up in jail or take it this far
It's true, I lied, but nobody's died
And these kids are having an incredible ride

You think you know it all, but you don't know me
See I'm more than just, Miss Spelling Bee

Take pictures, get gritty
On your first night out in the big, bad city
You're a cool girl, Jenny
But I'm pretty cool too

In fact,  I'm just as a great as a
Babysitter as you, ha
